# Student Attendance Detection

This project is a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning project that focuses on the detection of fraudulent activities in banking transactions. With a dataset comprising a staggering 6.3 million rows, we explored, preprocessed, and built predictive models to enhance the security of financial systems.

## Project Overview

In today's world, where financial fraud is a growing concern, the need for robust fraud detection systems is paramount. This project dives deep into the realm of data analysis, visualization, and machine learning to identify fraudulent activities within massive datasets.

### Data Preprocessing

- **Cleaning Data:** Handling null values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating relevant features and converting categorical data for model training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Leveraging EDA techniques and various visualizations to understand the data's characteristics.

### Machine Learning Model

- **Model Building:** Constructing a robust predictive model for real-time fraud detection.
- **Balancing Data:** Addressing class imbalances to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation:** Using appropriate metrics to validate the model's effectiveness.

### Impact

- Our project aims to make the financial sector more secure and fraud-resistant.
- It utilizes data science and machine learning to provide a shield against financial fraud, benefiting both institutions and consumers.
